[x] Update art for existing glimmers so they look pretty (i.e. ominous, fungus)
[x] Give all glimmers spawn rates
[ ] Fix glimmer spawn rates so that it averages out and doesn't inflate the spawn chances of all glimmers
[x] Make glimmers work with plasma beams
 - [x] Make Copi's new code not crash when invis glimmer is used
[x] Inject new glimmers into the spell list
[x] Make the new glimmers spawn somewhere
 - [x] Bunker
 - [x] Lab
[x] Add compatibility with Pride Glimmers mod
[x] Allow for tinkering inside the lab & bunker
[x] Add lore and make that spawn in the lab
[ ] Figure out a way to allow glimmer alchemy
    - add sensors in basins? (simple)
    - make it into a reaction (complex)
[x] Possibly keep the lab un-populated until you enter the portal the correct way?
[ ] Possibly make biome glimmer not do glimmer things in _EMPTY_ biome?
[ ] Find a way append the new glimmer changes into colour_spell.lua instead of gsubbing?
[ ] Find a way to systematically create glimmer .xml scripts
 - [ ] Possibly allow for the creation of unique glimmers for every color material? I could use chem curiosities' color finder function
