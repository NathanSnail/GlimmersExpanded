Gonna try and add a quest to unlock these. Ideas for the Glimmer Quest:
- Fungal shift inside the glimmer lake bunker to unlock the transmuted glimmers
- Create an alchemy lab that requires you to mix materials to create glimmers
  - Secret item to open a portal to the secret alchemy lab
  - One glimmer is created, with material residue nearby.
  - Various empty and full flasks and pouches lie around the room
  - Basins meant to hold materials & symbols on them
  - Recipe:
    - Blank Glimmer
    - Material
    - Catalyst?


What is needed for a new glimmer:
- A gun_actions.lua entry
- A translation in translations.csv
- An icon
- An entry in init.lua
- An .xml file
