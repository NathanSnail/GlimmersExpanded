This mod adds 16 new glimmer spells! 3 of them can be found in the usual bunker that the glimmer spells are at, but the other 13 have a bit of a... twist to them. Visit the glimmer bunker for more details!
This mod also adds glimmer alchemy! The process includes:
- A recipe: [spoiler]Australium + any Glimmer spell + any liquid.[/spoiler]
- This creates [spoiler]a glimmer colored similarly to the liquid involved.[/spoiler]
- The secondary recipe for [spoiler]Australium[/spoiler] is [spoiler]urine + pus + flummoxium[/spoiler], three materials that may be hard to come by.

Please, especially give me feedback on the alchemy part of the mod! Depending on how difficult or tedious the alchemy ends up being, I may change the materials involved.

Also, for those wondering, this *is* compatible with a multitude of mods, the most notable being Pride Glimmers (which also adds spells and shelves inside of the glimmer bunker). If you do find a bug, please let me know and I'll look into patching it as soon as I can."
