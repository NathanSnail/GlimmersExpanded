I could stop here and live happily with my accomplishment. I could spend the rest of my days resting, content in knowing I have accomplished more than most can claim...\n \nBut then I would never know what could have been.\n \nThat settles it. Tomorrow, I will continue my research. It is much too late tonight... ah. I have realized I am out of coffee grounds.

It seems the Art not only applies to the physical, but to the magical as well--in more ways than one. More experiments must be done to prove this, but, if I am correct, the combination of magic and material will produce truly unique effects. I am excited to see what innovations are produced from this discovery.\n \nIt has occurred to me that this practice might need a name. 'Magiterialchemy' has a nice ring to it, even though it is a mouthful. I quite like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If not for my prior alchemical knowledge, I would most surely have drowned. However, not all is lost. I managed to salvage what little I could of the bunker after it crashed at the bottom of the lake, and reinstated it as an underwater lab. Complete with a portal to and from, no less!

After weeks of tirelessly toiling at the cauldron, I have discovered a mixture of liquid confusion, poisoned blood, and Our Water that forms a peculiar yellow liquid which quickly evaporates.

This research granted neither wealth nor power, but something else entirely: Joy.\n \nA practice I am coining 'Magiterialchemy' is the infusion of traditional alchemy with magic. Its uses are currently heavily limited, and I have only managed to infuse materials with my own Glimmers. However, the results are far from disappointing. Magic infused with lava or acid is always a spectacular sight to see.\n \nThe process is fairly simple. Collect a large amount of the material you would like to infuse a Glimmer with, then submerge the Glimmer inside it. Then, let it simmer over a small amount of Australium. The reaction should happen fairly quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
