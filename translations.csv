I could stop here and live happily with my accomplishment. I could spend the rest of my days resting, content in knowing I have accomplished more than most can claim...\nBut then I would never know what could have been.\nThat settles it. Tomorrow, I will continue my research. It is much too late tonight... ah. I have realized I am out of coffee grounds. I'll need to speak with Graham soon to acquire more; I cannot *live* without that sweet, sweet aroma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

bookdesc_glimmers_expanded_hidden_alchemy_4,"While my hunch was correct, I doubt I have grasped the entirety of what I have discovered. It seems the Art not only applies to the physical, but to the magical as well--in more ways than one. More experiments must be done to prove this, but, if I am correct, the combination of magic and material will produce truly unique effects.\nI am excited to see what innovations are produced from this discovery. Perhaps, if someone more knowledgeable than I stumbled upon my work, they might produce some truly beautiful results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After weeks of tirelessly toiling at the cauldron, I have discovered a mixture of liquid confusion, poisoned blood, and Our Water that forms a peculiar yellow liquid which quickly evaporates. I was lucky enough to collect a sample to test with. It's cold to the touch yet bubbles like it's boiling, and can solidify even the most intense heat. That solid it produces also has some peculiar properties... More experiments will be conducted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Luckily, I seem to have stumbled upon a recipe lost to the ages, the one spoken about in our tablets. Our Medicine, capable of healing all the diseases of the flesh.\nNow, not even death will stop me... I won't let it. I refuse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
