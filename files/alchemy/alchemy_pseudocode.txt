So!! You want to create glimmers, do you? Well, look no further, because this is how it's gonna happen!

We need to:
 - Provide australium, a glimmer spell, and some material
 - When those come in contact, it uses up the australium and the glimmer, and creates a new glimmer
 - The new glimmer is based on the color of the material used

So, break that down into steps:
 - Reaction: australium + material = air + material, consume all
 - Reaction spawns an entity to run a lua script that removes the old spell, adds a new one, and does gfx

But we can't identify which material is being used as the lua script is being run, so we need to...
Systematically create reactions for every liquid in the game.

The process:
 - Grab a list of every liquid
 - Loop through all liquids, and:
    - Identify if the liquid is any of the transmuted glimmers
    else...
    - Grab their color
    - Identify which glimmer color they are closest to
    end
    - Create a reaction that involves those materials (australium + [material] = air + [material])
    - Have that reaction spawn an entity that runs a script which spawns the appropriate glimmer
